I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at the Paul G. Allen School for Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington, where I am advised by Tom Anderson and Ratul Mahajan. Previously, I completed both my B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science at Stanford University, where I was advised by Keith Winstein. I am broadly interested in networked systems and performance, specifically within the context of large-scale cloud computing.
